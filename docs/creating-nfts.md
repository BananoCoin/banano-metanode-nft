# creating nfts

if using pinata to upload the JSON you need a pinata api key. We use the JWT.

    https://pinata.cloud/documentation

here's the instructions so far:
    - if you want a vanity, create one, and set the seed.
    - get api key from pinata
    - go to https://nft.coranos.cc/
    - fill out the JSON form
    - it will return a CID. click 'GET CID Info' with the new CID.
    - if CID info returns click 'mint nft'
    - 'check ownership' should say you own it.
    - use 'transfer nft' to send it.
    - 'check ownership' should say someone else owns it, and shows the history.
