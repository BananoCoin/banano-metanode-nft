#todo
- do more input validation on the site. such as for bad banano addresses or bad hashes.
- change 'transfer nft' to a dropdown.
- add whitelisted template owners, template owner forgeries, and template asset forgeries (over asset count)
- (bug) figure out why you can't send two assets to the same account withount recieving the first asset first.
- (bug) figure out why you have to refresh the template before the ownership change shows up.
